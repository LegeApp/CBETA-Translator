# Code of Conduct

## Our Goal

CbetaZenTexts and CBETA Translator exist to make the CBETA canon more accessible through collaborative translation.

We want a space that is:

- Respectful
- Constructive
- Focused on the texts
- Open to improvement

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- Be respectful in discussions and pull requests
- Offer constructive feedback
- Critique ideas and translations, not people
- Respect the non-commercial requirement of CBETA materials
- Preserve XML structure and CBETA headers

Disagreements about translation are normal.  
Handle them professionally.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following will not be tolerated:

- Harassment or personal attacks
- Hate speech
- Deliberate XML corruption or malicious changes
- Removal or alteration of CBETA license headers
- Commercial exploitation of CBETA materials

## Translation Disagreements

Translation philosophy may vary.

This project supports:

- Machine translation workflows
- Iterative improvement
- Transparent annotation of methods

If you disagree with a translation:

- Open an issue
- Suggest improvements
- Submit a better version
- Open a thread on /r/zen for public discussion

Do not attack contributors personally.

## Enforcement

Maintainers reserve the right to:

- Reject pull requests
- Revert problematic changes
- Remove contributors who repeatedly violate these guidelines

The goal is stability and collaboration, not punishment.

---

## Final Note

Respect the material.
Respect each other.
Keep it non-commercial.
